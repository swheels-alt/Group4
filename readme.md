# Transport Network System

CS340 Project at SIUE, from the rubric:

"This project is designed to simulate the development of a real-world software system in a collaborative environment. It challenges your understanding of core data structures (graphs, heaps, hash maps, queues, stacks, trees) and emphasizes code modularity, interface design, and progressive system building. By working in teams, you'll practice dividing responsibilities, integrating components, and maintaining clean, reusable code across stages."
